Symfony framework 3.4 connecting to an Oracle DB
====================================================

Symfony 3.4 project just configured to access an Oracle database

## Description

Symfony comes with default configuration to a MySQL DB. From that initial project,
we configure step by step the project to connect to a Oracle DB.

Thereso, this project illustrate the configuration of a symfony 3.4 project in order to
interact with a Oracle Database instead of the default MySQL config.

## Prerequisites

* Symfony installer installed - no pun intended :-)!
* Oracle instant client v.12 min installed
    * For Windows, install the client with the administration mode and make sure to set php_oci8_12c extension manually in the **right** php.ini
    * For Linux, [visit this tutorial](https://gist.github.com/hewerthomn/81eea2935051eb2500941a9309bca703 "Install OCI on Linux"). Worked like a charm for me :-).

## Environment

* Oracle Database of course
* Wamp or similar tool with PHP 7.x
